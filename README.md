### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are very important to understand and this role is normally taken by the product owner whereby the product owner communicates with the client/customer to understand what they need; the product owner uses this information to create product backlog and user stories as well as uses this information and relays it to the Scrum master who then helps organize and coordinate scrum events with the rest of the team.

User stories are great to elaborate functionality from the user’s perspective defining the how and purpose of a feature. User stories also promote collaboration within the team.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

As per my previous experience, my team and I used the scrum process where we worked on projects in smaller tasks and iterated accordingly as well as prioritized features and did as many user interviews as possible to make sure the product met the user needs and client satisfaction.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member always communicates as well as work collaboratively with other team members. I find working in a team, you always have to communicate your progress and be transparent, in addition to that as a good team member you need to be dedicated and always willing to help other team members, willing to help others and receiving help from others is a major aspect to have.
